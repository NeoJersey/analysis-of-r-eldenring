      "Because I have no self respect, I spent 6.5 hours on this boss fight trying to beat her without summons, bloodhound step, or magic. Malenia is in my and many others opinion the hardest boss in the game. She requires an insane amount of precision and her life steal mechanic makes running shield builds almost impossible.

She’ll hit you for maybe 2 swipes and then go past you, it minimizes the most amount of damage compared to anything else I’ve found. For the second part, once she winds up to turn around and dash again, dodge backwards. She should not be able to reach you as long as you’ve stood still and this will give you time to heal if needed or counter attack once her flurry is done.

The second is that he bears an immense legacy on his shoulders. When the Elden Ring was shattered, Godrick was likely able to assert some sort of dynastic claim to this shard, otherwise I do not think he would have been afforded it. Godrick was clearly aware of his weaknesses when compared to his peers and set about finding a way to compensate. His chosen method was, of course, grafting. \n",

      "For Godrick this was not only a way of achieving personal strength, but also to restore the glory of the Golden Lineage; he wanted to live up to the reputation of Godfrey and Godwyn and return to Leyndell as a true heir of that bloodline. I suspect the anchor rune might have been the key to the extensive grafting- just as it anchors the other parts of Elden Ring together, it might allow its bearer to \"anchor\" more power to themselves.

Another member of the Golden Lineage, Godefroy, is also grafted to Godrick's extent. Godefroy was imprisoned by a Leyndell Knight, suggesting that perhaps Godrick and Godefroy perhaps rebelled or simply that grafting itself is seen as unsavoury. \n",

      "\n",
      "Going down the rabbit hole of lore this game has, I first noticed something odd that took me a while to realize. Alecto, ringleader of the black knife, is the same Alecto from greek/roman myth. She is part of the Furies (Any Hades fans out there). Now, the Furies were said to be born from the primordial god Nyx(Also known as Nox/Nok in Roman mythology). Nox is the primordial god born from Chaos. There are also more primordial gods. I think the entire point of Rannis quest is to show you that she has discovered Nox.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now back to Radagon. In Orphic cosmogony, Phanes is often equated with Eros or Mithras, and has been depicted as a deity emerging from a cosmic egg, entwined with a serpent. He had a helmet and had broad, golden wings. He is tbe Deity of precreation and life, and the God of light. He is also known to be HERMAPHRODITIC. At some point, Radagon split his female and male side, creating marika, possibly using the crucible of life. He came to life before the 6 Gods of Roman mythology. \n",
      "\n",
      "My theory is that the Amber Egg that Radagon leaves Renalla is actually the same cosmic egg he is born from. Ranni discovers this and also discovers Nox, the goddess of Night, the real wife of Radagon/phanes(supposed sister or wife). \n",
      "\n",
      "I believe the reason Ranni conspires Godwyns murder is because he is next in line to become the leader of the Golden Order. However, the only part of the human that is said to be divine is your soul, and your body is holding your freedom of divinity down. So thats why she leaves Godwyn with no soul, and why she has no body. Shes become part of the celestial divinity.\n",

Ornstein and Smough has always been my number one boss(es) I struggled the most against, until Malenia, you know you built a bad boss when you have to change your build to a bleed build to be able to handle her which is a shame cause I want to do it with my FTH build but she’s very strong against that, so that character I and you worked on? Nope change that. She nullifies just about every build in the game and forces you to “adapt” in a very unsatisfying way, which is just respec. I know everyone else is the same too cause just about all summons and ghosts I can see around are bleed builds too.

      "\n",
      "Felt like writing up my feelings on these bosses so here you go. Looking forward to hearing how your experiences differ from mine :)\n",
      "\n",
      "The difficulty of a boss depends on when you fight them of course, in this game especially. However, I think I was pretty much at more or less the right level for all of these, so I feel like I got a pretty authentic impression of the fight in most cases. I fought most bosses solo, though I did summon for a few of them like some of the duo fights for example (Never used Mimic Tear or any cheese tactics though). One fight I'm leaving out is Godfrey/Hoarah because I beat him on my second try and didn't really get a good impression of the fight I feel. Also didn't get to fight Fortissax or whatever his name is.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's kind of hard to determine what is and isn't considered a \"main\" boss, a field boss, a mini boss and what have you. So just bear with me in case you feel some of these don't fit the bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "**EASY**\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Mimic Tear** (Enjoyment: B-). Fun encounter, even though in practice it's not much of a challenge.  I was surprised to see it actually used the consumables I had equipped at the time and did a somewhat good job of mimicking my fighting style - wasn't hard to outsmart it though.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Gideon Ofnir** (Enjoyment: C). Basically just an NPC fight. He spams magic all day, so stay up in his face and get him outta here. Not really meant to be a challenge like most other bosses, this encounter serves more of a narrative purpose than a gameplay one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Regal Ancestor Spirit** (Enjoyment: A). It's not a complete cakewalk as this version has a little more to it than the regular ancestor spirit. However, most attacks are still easily dodged, the blue flames he spews were never a problem for me and the boss also doesn't have too much HP (He heals now, though).\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Astel, Naturalborn of the Void** (Enjoyment: B). Most attacks are easy to dodge I find. He has a lot of AoEs, probably to discourage you from just staying underneath him all the time. I don't think I ever died to his claw attacks or the little explosions that happen afterwards. Never really had any issues with the meteorites either. The grab attack he sometimes does after teleporting has a HUGE hitbox, you'll get grabbed even if you're nowhere near where his hands are. Just attack his head, but watch out for his quick pincer attacks. Overall not a very hard boss, but certainly stands out for his design and atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "**AVERAGE**\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Leonine Misbegotten** (Enjoyment: B-). Ridiculously fast, ferocious and also damaging thanks to that huge sword he wields. Kind of a glass cannon boss, it doesn't take that much to beat him but mess up and you'll be dead within seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Magma Wyrm Makar** (Enjoyment: B-). The camera can get slightly problematic here I think, but not a very hard boss overall. Some of the lava will stay on the floor for a while (Like in the Quelaag fight in DS1) which can make dodging and finding openings a little more difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy** (Enjoyment B). Using the serpent hunter weapon you're given feels amazing. It has incredible reach and hitting the boss with it just feels super satisfying. I much prefer this to Yhorm in DS3 as this time, they were nice enough to let you pick up and equip the weapon *before* starting the actual fight. More of a spectacle boss I'd say, but the snake bites can catch you off-guard and the insanity that is the 2nd phase attack with the skulls coming at you while Rykard charges his sword for a huge strike is incredibly dangerous.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Placidusax** (Enjoyment: A). The only boss I beat on my first try. It was a close call though, and I still feel like I got a pretty good impression of the fight. His claw attacks are fairly easy to avoid, and I always managed to evade the lightning strikes quickly enough. He has a HUGE AoE you need to run from as far as humanly possible. Other than that running to his tail worked well for me when trying to avoid other attacks like his flame breath. Great boss overall, the moments where he comes flying from the sky especially are amazing. If you stay locked on to him, you'll always know where he's gonna appear next while he's teleporting all over the place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Godfrey (Shade)** (Enjoyment: B-). Kind of underwhelming when you first fight him here. It's a solid fight, but it just seemed like it was missing that special something. He mostly just does melee attacks with his axe and back when I first beat him it felt like there should have been a phase 2 for someone as important as him - though as we'd find out close to the end, this wouldn't be the last time we'd fight him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Godrick the Grafted** (Enjoyment: A). I'd say this entire first part of the game is perfect. Exploring Limgrave was fun, but Stormveil Castle reminded me that I was playing a Souls game by presenting me with an incredibly intricate and complex area. Godrick is the cherry on top, he's not too hard, but his difficulty is perfect considering he's most likely your first major boss. Just a perfectly executed boss. The second phase (As well as the phase transition) is also incredibly good, the voice actor did a great job (Can't get that incredible delivery on \"BEAR WITNESS!!!!\" out of my head).\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella** (Enjoyment: B). Something tells me that a lot of people will encounter the boss pretty late in the game and be able to deal with it easily. When I got here though, this guy was a challenge. First phase is mostly just dodging his arm attacks and figuring out where to roll to be able to best punish him. Did die quite a few times though. He has a huge phase transition that gives him wings and adds lightning to his arsenal. Figured out pretty quickly that the lightning on the ground is best dodged by running to either side. Other than that it's similar to before except his attacks are more dangerous. Beating this boss felt very satisfying.\n",
      "\n",
      "**HARD**\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Red Wolf of Radagon** (Enjoyment: B-). Another ridiculously fast and aggressive boss with somewhat low HP. Pretty cool fight, but there's not that much too much to it, just dodge and hit. The most difficult part is when he summons three magic missiles but then attacks you immediately after, requiring you to dodge both him and the magic at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Fire Giant** (Enjoyment: C+). Not quite sure how to feel about this boss, might need to fight him again to get a better understanding of him. First phase is pretty standard as far as giant fights go: Just hit his feet and pay attention to when he's gonna do a big move. In phase 2 I never really figured out how or where to best attack him. His hands work best I think, but he doesn't give you as much of an opportunity to hit them. It can get pretty annoying when the exploding fire balls make it so that you can't safely approach him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Margit, the Fell Omen** (Enjoyment: A). What a way to start off the game. Most people interpret the difficulty of this boss as a way of the game telling the players to go out and explore instead of just bashing their heads against a wall here. I had a fun experience with Margit: When I first got to him he crushed me. After exploring in Limgrave for a while and coming back he was still too strong for me, though I did feel like I had made some progress. And then the final time I returned to him some time later, I told myself that I was strong enough and that I was gonna attempt him as many times as it took now. And then, after a few attempts, I finally did it. Defeating Margit really feels like *overcoming* something. Great design I'd say. His first phase isn't that threatening, but I STILL don't know how to properly dodge some of those second phase combos...\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Godskin Noble** (Enjoyment C+). Didn't expect him to be so fast when I first encountered him. His rolling attack is a little TOO difficult to dodge I find, you have to roll through it at the PERFECT moment (And even then, he might come back around and just hit you anyway).\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon** (Enjoyment: B-). The first phase may be incredibly easy, but it's still fun I think. Being attacked with flying books and chandeliers falling from the ceiling is great. I feel like they didn't have to stop the enemies from attacking you when Rennala falls to the ground though, still having to dodge while hitting her could have made this part of the fight more exciting. Phase 2 is the real deal though, if you don't manage to close the distance to her then her onslaught of magic will be *relentless*. Her being able to summon creatures to help her was the cherry on top and made the final part of the fight incredibly intense.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Valiant Gargoyles** (Enjoyment: C+). One of the better duo fights because at least you get to whittle down the first gargoyle's HP a bit before the second one joins the fight (Remind you of something?). At that point the fight gets really tricky though since they're both melee fighters and can close the distance very quickly (Depending on what weapon they're currently using). You're forced to play incredibly safe, which can make the fight last excruciatingly long. Maybe a different kind of arena with a way to break up aggro and separate them could have made this fight more enjoyable for solo players. I ended up summoning here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Commander Niall** (Enjoyment: C). Those two knights he summons on their own were already incredibly tough to take down, and taking both of them as well as the boss on at the same time just seemed ludicrous. I watched someone do it solo and it is definitely possible, but I ended up summoning good ol' Kristoff here who handled them like a champ (Though it still took a few tries to take down the knights). Niall on his own is still somewhat difficult however, he has some huge frost/lightning attacks that can be very intimidating.\n",

      "\\- **Godskin Duo** (Enjoyment: D+). Could have been a cool fight. I like that you can use the pillars in the arena to your advantage, but I feel like it's kind of ruined by the Noble being as fast as he is. You'd think he'd be a little slower, but no, he has ridiculously fast rapier attacks that reach really far. The Noble and the Apostle are fairly close to each other at pretty much all times due to moving at roughly the same speed. If they didn't, then this fight could have had a kind of O&amp;S dynamic. As it is, it just feels kind of bullshit though, like they just threw two existing bosses (Who only really work when they're on their own) in a room together and called it a day. I'd say just summon for this one (Or cheese it) to even the odds a little. Actually though, sleep seems to work wonders here as well, maybe I'll try and utilize that in my next run.\n",

      "\\- **Morgott** (Enjoyment: A). \"Margit's\" great return. Damn what a fight, incredibly intense and fast-paced. He was very difficult to me due to how fast he is and how his combos are even longer than before, but still very fun. Nothing else to say really, it's just Margit but on steroids (Which is great). I have seen that some people were able to just kind of bum-rush him due to going in with really high DPS. Maybe this boss could benefit from a slightly larger health pool, not sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Radahn** (Enjoyment: B-). Still not really sure how to feel about this one. I almost never summon for bosses in these games due to personal preference, but this is an exception, summoning the NPCs feels appropriate here. I think in practice it's very clumsy though, it's just a hassle to summon them while you're already inside the arena (Especially if you're online and there's so many messages on the ground that it becomes a struggle to even activate the summon signs...). Maybe they could have just placed the signs outside the arena; and given the NPCs more health instead of making it possible to re-summon them. This way, standing on the sidelines and just continually re-summoning NPCs to win (Which doesn't seem like a very fun or interesting strategy...) wouldn't be possible. I love the sheer spectacle of this fight though, and Radahn seems like a great character lore-wise. One of the first times in these games I was actually *scared* of a boss - like, those gravity attacks are no joke. Seeing him approaching with 4 giant f\\*cking meteors over his head probably made my character shit himself. Fought him pre-patch btw\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Mohg, Lord of Blood** (Enjoyment: B+). Great Boss, he was my personal demon for a while. Spent two whole evenings trying to defeat him to no avail. I like the *idea* with the phase transition attack, but what I don't like is that you need something from outside of the boss fight to be able to deal with it. I never liked that sort of thing. It's a great discovery if you DO find it before the fight and remember to use it, but if you don't then there's no way of knowing that it even exists (That's me. Eventually looked it up and got that tear because I just could *not beat him* without it). That's really my only complaint though, learning his moveset was very satisfying.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Radagon / Elden Beast** (Enjoyment: A-). Great final boss. Radagon is somewhat straightforward. He demolished me the first few attempts, but after that, dodging his melee swings became more like a dance and was very satisfying to pull off. He's one of those bosses where the easiest moves to dodge are somehow also the ones that leave him open the longest. I feel like you can kind of get lucky or unlucky depending on which moves you get. It's likely that his posture will be broken if you just keep at it, potentially making this phase not last as long. This boss gives you very little opportunity to heal however - I'd say only heal after dodging a move where you would normally attack. I wouldn't advise keeping your distance to heal because he can close the gap incredibly quickly. I never really figured out how best to deal with the teleports - I didn't see a way to predict what move he does when he reappears, making timing your rolls tricky. He f\\*cked me over with that a lot of times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's the Elden Beast. First off stunning visually (Radagon is too, of course). Hitting it feels very satisfying somehow, probably because of the sound effects. The moveset here is challenging but perfectly reasonable and doesn't necessarily require you to memorize all of it (I knew instinctively what to do even without knowing the attack beforehand), which is welcome since this is basically the second boss you have to fight in a row. Dodging the projectiles is tricky but definitely doable with good timing, while that ring attack is just kind of weird (Seems like there's different versions of it?). Also never really knew what to make of those flickering lights that float around and occasionally hit you. The sword strikes are very similar to Rykard's, they take a while to actually come out so you'll have to avoid rolling too early. Awesome fight overall. Equipping a talisman that boosts holy damage negation is very helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- **Maliketh** (Enjoyment: B-). This could have been the best fight in the whole game, but some elements just kind of sour it for me. First off not a big fan of the first phase. It's *fine* once you start to figure out when he's open to attack, but man, he's just ridiculously ferocious and fast. Very stressful, and not in a particularly fun way. The second phase is the real meat of the fight, and I do like it A LOT. However, Maliketh does an incredible amount of damage in addition to the life drain effect AND the max HP reduction. I just feel like he didn't need ALL of that. On the other hand though, he doesn't have a lot of HP himself, so it takes just a handful of good/lucky dodges to take him down. I probably would have preferred it if the fight lasted longer (Give him more HP basically), but make his attacks not be *as* destructive to compensate. Also, the pillars are great for dealing with the first phase, but I think it would have been cool if they were destroyed for the second phase (Kind of like Sister Friede's phase transition changing the arena in DS3 for example) since they're more of a hindrance there.\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm a huge From Soft fan. My highlight of the games is always trying to beat the hardest bosses by fair means; and succeeding after many, many tries, making you feel like you've mastered them. Throughout my experiences with the series, I tried to beat every boss (On my own) in order to \"complete\" the respective game, and I did end up beating every boss in Souls history up to this point. This is the first time I gave up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have attempted this boss (solo melee, about level 150) an innumerable amount of times, just to be able to say I beat her. I fought her for more than 8 hours over the course of 4 days, and at some point you just gotta draw the line and set priorities. Tried all the upgraded weapons at my disposal and even respecced 4 separate times just to try and see if changing up my stats could help me. I did get to the second phase a number of times but never really came close to finishing the fight. It's not an \"impossible\" boss by any means of course, but I guess I just never got as gud as other players did, cause I just can't do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the main problems for me is the huge whirlwind attack, which is the attack that killed me the most by far and also kind of ruins the fight for me. You can't rely on instinct, you HAVE to memorize it: Run away as far as you possibly can, then roll in, then stay away. Pretty much the only even remotely reliable way of getting out alive as far as I can tell. Stand too close to her when she does it or do literally anything before she leaps into the air and you're pretty much dead meat, especially if your HP isn't at 100%. It kind of drags her whole moveset (Which is otherwise entirely reasonable!) down with it because if you want to be prepared for it, you have to play *ridiculously* cautiously and basically start running backwards after doing literally anything JUST in case she decides to do it again (Phase 2 makes this incredibly difficult since she's a lot more aggressive and therefore stays a lot closer to you throughout the fight). Also, it seems like she can sometimes cancel her endlag after certain attacks, and if she decides to transition into THIS move, then it's basically over, no way to get away in time (She also did it right out of a stagger at times if I remember correctly - sometimes before my attack animation was even finished...).\n",
      "\n",
      "I think what I hate most about the move is she doesn't even leave herself open after she does it - if you *don't* end up in a bad spot when healing or attacking afterwards, then only because her AI arbitrarily decided to be merciful enough to not start another attack immediately. She's basically right back on her feet after doing it as if it was just any other move, which just doesn't sit right with me. It should feel *rewarding* to dodge that move. Instead you're just kind of wondering why she wouldn't just use it all the time, since nothing else she does compares. The same applies to the butterfly clone attack in phase 2 which I never in those many hours managed to survive even once when I was up close. It's fine if you're far away from her, but standing close makes you unable to see what is even happening sometimes. And even if you do dodge it, it has pretty much NO endlag at all - in most cases, she started another dangerous attack *immediately* after that final lunge forward.\n",

      "One of the main problems for me is the huge whirlwind attack which is the attack that killed me the most by far and also kind of ruins the fight for me You cant rely on instinct you HAVE to memorize it Run away as far as you possibly can then roll in then stay away Pretty much the only even remotely reliable way of getting out alive as far as I can tell Stand too close to her when she does it or do literally anything before she leaps into the air and youre pretty much dead meat especially if your HP isnt at 100 It kind of drags her whole moveset Which is otherwise entirely reasonable down with it because if you want to be prepared for it you have to play ridiculously cautiously and basically start running backwards after doing literally anything JUST in case she decides to do it again Phase 2 makes this incredibly difficult since shes a lot more aggressive and therefore stays a lot closer to you throughout the fight Also it seems like she can sometimes cancel her endlag after certain attacks and if she decides to transition into THIS move then its basically over no way to get away in time She also did it right out of a stagger at times if I remember correctly  sometimes before my attack animation was even finished\n",
      "\n",
      "I think what I hate most about the move is she doesnt even leave herself open after she does it  if you dont end up in a bad spot when healing or attacking afterwards then only because her AI arbitrarily decided to be merciful enough to not start another attack immediately Shes basically right back on her feet after doing it as if it was just any other move which just doesnt sit right with me It should feel rewarding to dodge that move Instead youre just kind of wondering why she wouldnt just use it all the time since nothing else she does compares The same applies to the butterfly clone attack in phase 2 which I never in those many hours managed to survive even once when I was up close Its fine if youre far away from her but standing close makes you unable to see what is even happening sometimes And even if you do dodge it it has pretty much NO endlag at all  in most cases she started another dangerous attack immediately after that final lunge forward\n",

In Rannis ending, you push the greater will and order far away, so that it's meddling is reduced to what's barely nessecary to keep the world working. In Fias, you re-introduce death back into the lands between, allowing things to die normally and ridding the world of those who live in death.

And in both endings, I assume my character is more powerful than anything else, unable to be challenged by anything since pretty much every major power is already dead.

      "He took 13 bloody slashes at 733 damage a piece, and had what looks like literally 1 HP left. contrary to common belief, bloody slash does not proc bleed, so this is fairly straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "733*13+1=9530\n",
      "\n",
      "Next I watched [my friend's post-nerf video](https://youtu.be/KiA7soeX1ew) and added those numbers together. This was not nearly as straightforward lol. The damage numbers were as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1836+1084+3240+557+2097+594=9408\n",
      "\n",
      "We can't just take the damage number for the last hit, because it will show the full damage regardless of remaining HP, as is evident in my video. However, Radahn had a little chunk of HP left, certainly more than in my video, and I think 122 fits pretty well. Otherwise, they would only have changed his HP by an insignificant amount, which I think is unlikely, and irrelevant even if true.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it looks to me that Radahn, pre-nerf and post-nerf, has an HP pool of about 9,530. He does seem to go down quicker imo, so I would speculate they adjusted his defenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that I'm not posting this as an \"own\" on people who liked him more pre-nerf, especially considering I'm one of them, I just thought this was interesting and wanted to share what I learned.\n",

      "2990 Finding the meaning behind \"Nepheli Loux\" Been trying to find out the etymology for Nepheli Loux, and I've think I've got the answer:\n",

      "\n",
      "As far as I'm aware, \"Nepheli\" is not a name, nor is it a direct translation, but it does have a lot of similarities to a lot of Hebrew names and Judaeo-Christian religion.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "Nepheli is quite similar to the name, \"Nefteli/Nephteli,\" which is Hebrew to \"struggle,\" as well as the Judaeo-Christian figure of \"Naphtali,\" who was one of the 12 sons of Jacob and Bilhah, as well as the namesake of one of the 12 Tribes of Israel. \"Naphtali\" directly translates to \"my struggle,\" which seems to be a theme with the name. However, both \"Nefteli\" and \"Naphtali\" are masculine names, so I'd wager that From or JRRM decided to go for a  feminine corruption of the name to fit a female character. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nepheli is also similar to \"Nephilim,\" which is the counterpart to Seraphim, being mentioned multiple times in the Jewish Bible, specifically the Tanakh. Nephilim directly translates to either \"Fallen\" or \"Fallen Angel,\" and both etymologies are used in the Jewish Bible. \n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#x200B;\n",

      "&amp;#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "Loux is a lot more interesting, however. There's no Hebrew term that's close to Loux, and the only term that directly translates is the Greek \"λουξ,\" meaning luxury, which I don't think is right. My best guess is that its a corruption of the Latin word \"Lux,\" meaning \"light,\" which I feel is very fitting for either a last name or a title of a Badland warrior given that Hoarah has the same title/last name &gt;!especially since Godfrey means \"to be one with God,\" which is a very fitting name to be associated with Light.!&lt;\n",

      "1. So first thing's first. You should only use jump attacks . There is no point in trying to combo her, she'll just parry and jump away. Jump attacks and maybe a hit if you have a faster weapon (attempted with a pair of sabres before). Also run, a lot, running makes everything easier and you can dodge many attacks with it as well as gain momentum for your jump. Also you should dodge and not block everything you  can. She will heal through your shield and wi scarlett rot you in the aecond phase.\n",

      "\n",
      "4 When he arm clicks and she goes for the triple swipe dodge to the right and into her. That way you can avoid every attack consistently, rolls aren't fast enough to dodge them separately. Otherwise always dodge back on combo attacks (non-charge attacks).\n",

Who in their right mind thought that, what essentially is, a 4v1 gank would be fun? Millicent staggers way to easily, and she's worthless unless she's using the Waterfowl Dance. Can't leave her with more than 1 invader or she gets melted. Can't have more than 1 invader on you, because at 45 VGR, most hits will take away over a third of my health. And since I'm a summon sign, I'm left with half the flasks I'd normally have. Most NPC invaders aren't bad at all, but having FOUR very tanky, high damage NPC invaders is really poor design, especially since you can't hardly break aggro, and they hardly vary in speed. Hell, the NPC trio you fight for Fia's questline isn't even remotely as bad. Not to mention a good portion of the arena is scarlet rot.

Now for the duo and Maliketh, if you needed to heal, the pillars were your sanctuary (and I actually liked Maliketh though I did use his Blasphemous Claw for parrying when I could, I'm sure those who didn't use it may not like him as much considering what I've read). For other bosses, such respite doesn't exist.

      "Phase 1 was everything you'd want in a Soulsborne fight, aggression, clear punish windows, clear opportunities to heal with patience, rhythm, and more opportunities to learn and deal even more DPS by experimenting which attacks you can sneak in that extra hit safely. Phase 1 was a freaking blast. Then phase 2 came. Phase 2 was why this boss took my like 3 hours. I don't mind the flashy grapples, what I did mind was that if they caught me, it was literally a coin toss if he would let me even recover afterwards. About 50% of my deaths were him not letting that happen. Mind you I'm not panic rolling, but the moves he (and other) bosses can use after hurting you often require such precise dodge timing with no clear tells that it often leads to a loading screen. His upheaval comes to mind. Phase 1, the visual tell to dodge is when he pulls on the axe. Phase 2, he does the pulling animation for a bit longer so you need to have a mental timer to dodge it which can be screwed up if you're in recovery mode. Point is, after getting rocked, this boss has a good chance of killing you before you can even heal, RNG almost needed to be on your side for this. Worst is you had to go through phase 1 everytime to practice phase 2 and phase 1 could take longer if the boss just patiently walks back and forth, waiting for an input from you. Second you get hit though, mainly in phase 2, that passive nature goes out the window.\n",

He hits *extremely* hard so you're going to need to heal after you got hit. Turns out getting hit period was the mistake. Your run ended as soon as any attack connected on you because the amount of times he would do a lightning shotgun that comes out...lightning quick after hitting me was absurd. In anticipation one run, he even did it three times to follow up with his grab that I cannot dodge if he's too close due to its aoe and awkward timing. He has plenty of moves that catch you, and his frequent teleports *also* hurt you, causing you to need to heal but as per the whole point of this thread, good luck with that.\n",

Some may see that as too easy but that's the point, I should be rewarded for getting my face shoved in so much that I can read the bosses like a book. But at the same time, I shouldn't be expected to be laser perfect for *every* boss. Ultimately, I felt forced to use an ash on two fights in this game, Malenia and the final boss. If the final boss were two unconnected fights, this would be far better imo, but knowing that RNG can deplete my reserves before a whole separate boss fights made me feel horribly cornered.

Even though 3 was my least favorite due to combat mechanics and enemy behavior, at least it was doable. But here, the rolls just do not feel the same.

Roaming enemy groups look like they are almost always taking same routes, I just happen to catch them in a different portion of the route whenever I come back.

It just boils down to either get behind them for stealth kill or use horse to hit and run until nobody is left. \n",

I grinded at Malenia for 18-20 hours because I am not a great player and my experience has always come down to memorization rather than reaction-based play. I watched and studied no hit runs and guides that whole time too. These tips are based on what I observed and may not match others' experiences. They are also pretty speculative so if you want to take it with a grain of salt, that's fair. \n",

      "\n",
      "* spacing - Honestly, this is very difficult to describe and you feel just have to develop of feeling for it. There is a certain radius around her where she will attack immediately after you swing at her. This is to your advantage because it's one of the few times you can control her actions. If it feels like she wants to use water fowl, bait this radius to get her to use it. Just don't commit to the attack or use you'll be mid animation when she jumps in the air. I tried to always maintain awareness of how much space I had behind me to run away which means if she's against the wall and you're not, then you're in a good position. Be aware that rolling through certain moves will swap your positions as well.\n",

If she's landed attacks on you and healed, she can use it when above 75% hp. Sometimes it comes out as late as 50% health and part of me wonders if a lucky timed stagger cancelled the script. She will want to do it one more time below 50%, maybe twice if you take too long.\n",

All bosses in these games have a script of moves that determine what they're allowed to react and follow up with. The reason they slowly walk forward, strafe, and idle is to enter the spacing conditions to initiate these moves. The reason they jump away after you punish them is to reset this script. Malenia resets after finishing every normal move and after recovering from a stagger or getting up from a critical. When you swing at Malenia and she reacts by side stepping, she cannot follow up with water fowl. She has to do one of her normal moves, stop moving, and then enter water fowl. Be ready to back away at each reset if you have no means of staggering her again. If you're using bleed/frost and you think you're about to proc it but she jumps up, yolo it and do a jump attack. You might be able to stop her.\n",

Commit that to muscle memory and do not try to adjust bc the sudden camera swing can cause you to reflexively make adjustments.

      "7953 Malenia experience with random players So today I tried Elden Rings co-op feature for the first time. I have played over 90 hours without never touching the co-op.  It took me a while to find players on some boss areas (Im level +150, so I dont know if that matters while trying to co-op or not) so I decided to place my summon sign on the Malenia boss area, and in the first 30 seconds somebody summoned me, so I knew that was my place to try help other players out. It didint took many tries to understand that some players are very underleveled to that boss. I got summoned about 50 times and how many times did we beat the boss you might think? I beat the boss with randoms only 1 time, and all the other tries were unsuccesfull. I learned that many people dont understand Malenia's attack pattern and many players died in the first 30 seconds of the fight. I hate to say this but people really need to upgrade their vigor up, many of the players I played with died to 1 or 2 normal hits. Or they just panick rolled to their death. Many players started to panick when Malenia starts the swinging slash attack combo, and that was mainly the reason why people died, and its really frusrating that they dont understand to run away and get distance so they can survive the slashing attack. And by my suprise, when the 2nd half of the boss fight starts, many, like almost half of the players got hit by the big flower bloom attack that starts the 2nd half, I dont know why people dont understand to run away or dodge roll away from the attack aeo. Like how these players even got to this far at this game? Like im not the greatest souls player out there but I really dont suggest trying to \"farm\" runes by helping randoms with Malenia, at least before the game is little bit older and people get the grasp of the game mechanics. (I still dont know how they got this far at the game) In total I played 4 hours trying to help others in this boss and 1 time was succesful so please dont be like me and save your precious time, but if you have time to spare and dont get annoyed easily then go ahead and place your co-op sign there and enjoy the sweet sweet victory when you beat the boss. And if somebody is interested to see the many fails from that session, I made 12min video about it (I didint record every fight, the video has almost 40 different fights), so if somebody is interested or even reads this post to the end, comment and I will try to link the video to the comments if that is allowed :)\n",

      "7963 Why Elden Ring's Open World is SO GOOD (Essay) What you are seeing is a symptom of a well-designed open world, one that invites, encourages and rewards exploration, full of substantial content to discover on your own without map markers telling you to, and that knows how to reward the player if they explore as this world intends you to.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this seems very simple to achieve at first glance, but the truth is that it is anything but simple. The truth is that open world video games are proliferating more and more in the industry, that is indisputable; and I don't know if it will be your case, but I've been reading complaints about it for many years: “open world video games are becoming more and more and they are killing the industry, it seems that they are the natural evolution of absolutely any genre there has been and will be and Above all, they are slow, boring and unreliable hour-eaters”. The worst of all is that, removing the subjectivity that you may like more or less an open world video game, the truth is that this statement is not without reason: it is not just that this type of video game has grown like foam , but the vast majority are not even completely well executed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of you will have played The Witcher 3, an undisputed great game with a great narrative, great characters, an enviable technical and artistic section and a world that is not open to use as it is divided into different large areas but, anyway, full of content and secrets , as any open or semi-open world game should be. So far so good, but that's what I said at the beginning: (...) This is exactly what The Witcher 3 lacks: the world is not designed so that as you go around the map you detect points of interest to the which to go and that, along the way, other points of interest that make you change direction appear, just as it happened to me in the clip at the beginning of the video. In The Witcher 3, the world is not designed for this to happen, and if it does, it is on very, very specific occasions: to access the content that this world has to offer, here you must open the map, and once it is open, look on the different icons of it to decide where you want to go. So at the end of the day you are not exploring the world, you are simply going from point A to point B to find something of interest without anything really interesting happening along the way, making use of an object that eliminates any type of exploration real. This is not in itself bad, because at the end of the day the map does have a lot of content, it is not a mere wasteland in which there is nothing to do, but the exploration factor and the satisfaction it produces are completely lost discovering points of interest thanks to it, so that the world of this game, without being bad, is not ultra-groundbreaking either. \n",
      "\n",
      "The worst thing is that the case of TW3 is not one of the bloodiest, in fact it is one of the best exponents of open world video games, which does not speak well of the vast majority. I won't talk about Horizon Forbidden West because I haven't played it yet, but the world of Horizon Zero Dawn is precisely a clear example of what is wrong with this kind of video game: the world, again, is not designed to constantly capture your interest through exploration, but if you open the map you don't see anything special either; If you go around there, the only thing you see are repetitive enemies and from time to time, among so many trees and bushes, some buildings that, of course, are usually empty, so there are no rewards to reward exploration. The points of interest in this game arise from the main and secondary missions that the characters give you. Come on, not only does it try to get from point A to point B but it does it in a much worse way than The Witcher, not even having almost anything of interest outside of the missions. Most open worlds follow this formula, putting you in a time-consuming wasteland where missions and points of interest are spread out and artificially lengthening the duration by forcing you to take looooong walks to create the false sense that you're exploring the world, which you're not. It is true. Luckily, not everything is black: Elden Ring is a needle in a haystack, quite the opposite of the examples I have given before.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a game in which they give you a final goal but to reach it you have to explore the world, so the game lets you loose a few minutes after starting it so you can do the canelo around. In this game you can try to avoid any kind of exploration and go directly to the locations that seem important; however, being a tiered RPG, the bosses in these zones will most likely break your ass, leaving you with two options: git gud or explore the world to get stronger and then come back more prepared.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first such obstacle we encounter is Margit, who defends the entrance to Stormshroud Castle. Many people come across this boss very early and complain about its high difficulty, and that is normal, because Margit acts as a barrier between a very advanced area for the heights of the game where you are and Necrolimbo, which is the first area of the game. What Elden Ring tells you here is to explore, to discover the secrets of Necolimbo, which is not a small area at all, and when you feel ready, go back to Margit in order to progress. Necrolimbo is, in a word, fascinating: you can't spend more than 30 seconds going around without noticing something that captures your interest, and while you go towards that point, you will surely see 2 other points of interest, which overwhelms you and you don't know which point of interest to investigate first; each point of interest feels unique and you find mini-dungeons, dungeons, ruins, churches, swamps, beaches, shacks, catacombs, among other things; even if you don't see a clear point of interest, which doesn't usually happen, as soon as you get on the horse and ride around, passively exploring, you come across more points of interest. The other areas of the game, although they are not as great as Necrolimbo as the points of interest become repetitive and abuse recycling, they also have their good moments, and above all it is a great success that you do not have the world map from the beginning; in Elden Ring you have to look for the maps of each area, so when you get to these you go completely blind until you find the map, and this only reinforces the aspect of exploration, you have to be guided only and exclusively by what the game world shows you to decide where to go. Once you get the maps, this gets lost a bit, but it doesn't seem very serious to me either because the maps in this game don't act as a means to search for points of interest like The Witcher 3 did: rather they serve so that, once the points are located of interest, decide on the best route to them. I personally would completely remove the maps from this game so that the player could deduce how to get to each point of interest by analyzing the environments, but for people unfamiliar with this type of game it is understood that they would find something like this aberrational.\n",
      "\n",
      "This image, which by the way I have taken from this tweet, completely defines how exploration should be carried out in an open world. As soon as we leave the first interior of the game, this landscape is what we immediately see. What is most striking is this large tree that we know we will not be able to reach yet and this castle, which is much closer and makes us understand that, for now, we have to focus on getting there, and to the side we just see the area where we start the game and in which almost all of us die as soon as we start. However, first we must look at what is closest to us, and in order, we find a Grace, which are the rest points of the game and that we are going to recognize because we have already seen something like this during the tutorial. A little further on we have our first obstacle, which is an extremely strong enemy for our level and that will undoubtedly kick our ass, getting between us and the closest point of interest that we have, which teaches us that in situations where we are tremendously below the enemy, we can try to find detours to get where we want. The stage is also full of implicit lines that, without the players realizing it, point to the first point of interest and make our attention go there immediately, so that we don't miss the site, and the screen is divided into 3 sections: in the center we are, on the left we have the castle and the place where we started the game, and on the right we have the nearest point of interest, thus directing our interest to all the places on the screen. It is a wonder. This is what any open world should aim for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Skyrim of course has a great world and laid good foundations, but thanks to the genius of this design we have to give it to Zelda Breath of the Wild, which is several ranks above the rest, including Elden Ring, and which must be the role model for all future open world. It is not only that it is full of content, but unlike many other open worlds that serve as a mere obstacle between each point of interest, it turns the world itself into the gameplay, making the player forget about the main adventure and want to focus more on experimenting with the playable possibilities. In that game you can do what you want as long as your wits and arsenal allow it; It is no longer just that the exploration is masterfully executed as it is in Elden Ring, but that the world is literally at the service of the player: you can hunt animals, create all kinds of food but especially it has a fucking verticality thanks to the fact that you can climb walls and mountains; the game makes you feel like a real adventurer who decides his own path and where the world doesn't tell you where to go, but to do what you want. And for this, the always demanded random encounters of this type of game are not necessary; yes, it is good that they are but they are not necessary when you have a world like Breath of the Wild, in which the terrain is wild, there are few civilizations and during the whole adventure you are alone 99% of the time; and precisely the game shines because the player is alone, with survival mechanics that perfectly complement the gameplay by literally being able to do whatever you want with your arsenal and creating a much greater sense of adventure. \n",
      "\n",
      "That is why Elden Ring and Breath of the Wild are two great examples of how to design an open world, and the truth is that both benefit from having a very concise and scattered narrative that does not interfere with gameplay and that there are few NPCs to distract us of the true purpose of the game, which is to live a true adventure. That's why, in my opinion, a good open world cannot be supported by a narrative as omnipresent as that of The Witcher 3; Elden Ring has a great narrative that hardly interferes with the gameplay but is there, and that we can discover ourselves by exploring and reading descriptions of objects that we find through exploration. And that is precisely why it is so good, because it is very elaborate and yet it never deprives us of continuing to enjoy the game world through long cinematics and dialogues. That is why these two games are examples to follow for any company that really wants to design a remarkable open world video game.

Unfortunately one of my favorite attacks became rare once I discovered my dominating strategy.

      "Idling is something I mentioned on the Leonine Misbegotten boss and this is the perfect fight to discuss the problems with it but let me explain what it is first just in case someone is unaware of what transpires. Idling is a moment in a boss fight where nothing happens and can continue for an uncomfortable amount of time usually until either the boss snaps out of it or the player takes action. Personally this has happened to me several times throughout the series especially with fights like Artorias and Manus.  This is an issue that basically exists with every SoulsBlood game except maybe Sekiro since it's designed to basically keep combat flowing at all times due to the game punishing players wanting to play passively by making the battle longer which is what I did as a new player in Sekiro. While practicing Margit I noticed that there is a major aggression toward using items so I started throwing knives to knock the idling out. It did work for the most part however it left me vulnerable to the little summon daggers that Margit throws so I had to ditch that plan. I eventually just had to wait it out because walking up  to Margit also risked the same attack which has a very small animation right before a dagger is thrown plus I had to avoid getting hit by a huge combo that was devastating to get caught in. I'm currently working on a new weapon to help avoid this issue along with this weapon's terribly slow recovery time.\n",
      "My strategy had to be established around the slow recovery time of my weapon which only allows small moments to attack which is why I'm extremely passive in the second phase of this fight. My biggest challenge was avoiding the double swing of the cane and hammer which had a fairly tight window to dodge through. I couldn't go towards Margit due to the quick recovery attacks so I found a nice window by walking and dodging away. There was also a follow up attack which caught me off guard a lot where Margit launches towards me with a cane sweep however once I started to expect that it was no longer an issue. I really liked this fight and I wish my weapon of choice didn't compromise so much of it. One detail I found intriguing was this wind up attack that added a second swing if you were too far away. This attack was very convenient whenever I was very close because I could strafe and land a nice big charge attack. I actually had to specifically dodge to Margit's left side after the hammer slam to avoid fast recovery attacks if I got caught directly in front because this allowed attacks that I absolutely could not avoid due to once again my weapon's slow animation transition.  Another interesting obstacle was the objects on the sides of the arena. At first I thought this would be a major issue for the second phase then I discovered that I can get Margit just far enough to one side so I could walk right by without activating the brutal combo I mentioned earlier.  I'm looking forward to learning more about this fight because it's comfort is based on old roots.

So on my 2nd character I've decided to go full on heavy weapons with super heavy armor to wash out the terrible taste going sorcery had left me, which was long before most of the sorcery spells got buffed. But even with that terrible sorcery build, I could do extreme amount of damage to no end with comet azur. However I kid you not, my best \"spell\" was hoarfrost stomp, and I abhor that. But with this current build, although I've been plowing through things infinitely easier than my mage. I wasn't in constant need of help or an invincible bodyguard (crystalian). But my power feels like it's peaking. And my heavy prelate hammer is +20 and my seeing little gain in leveling up strength after 60. Just +3s. If it keeps up like that, then is 90 more attack power going to cut it make 99 strength worth it? No it wouldn't; it couldn't be that bad.\n",

      "I'm stuck doing 700s and 1000s while my ground slam or golden slam does 900s. Further increases by stats are so marginal it's not worth putting on Godrick's rune, Radagon's Sarseal, and the Starcourge talisman. All forms of self healing outside of tears is unreliable. That is especially the one that heals you with simply hitting people because it turns out it's PER ATTACK, NOT PER HIT. So dual wielding nor butt slamming a mob still only counts as 1 attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "The colossal hammer doesn't hit straight, so it's been so clumsy I often wonder if it was worth leaving my longhaft axe for this, the longest great axe in the game, which is so long that it actually attacks behind yourself with its standard light attacks. Even the difference in power makes me question if it was ever worth going to that prelate hammer. Or even the poise damage which has been growing more and more unreliable even with ground slam and jump attacks. For some STUPID reason certain man sized enemies like the banished knights can't be launched into the air, and can barely be face planted. So that's making me hesitant toward replacing the prelate hammer with the giant killer whose strong attack does not launch enemies into the air. \n",

      "Jump attacking with a colossal hammer has been growing increasingly inconsistent with many enemies beyond Margot, especially when more and more of these enemies turn into a whirlwind of death or emulate the fume knight, complete with FROSTBITE, every BREATHING moment, where now my only two choices to win is to abuse their shoddy hit boxes OR grab a tower shield effectively nerfing my poise and poise damage to the ground. And don't tell me to guard counter, because you need to do it at the **end** of these combos, otherwise you get hit and poise broken right out of it. And these combos last for so long that stance breaking is just unreliable, more like happy accident when it DOES happen.\n",

      "So I look into guide vids to see how people are doing extreme damage since you really need to do extreme damage at the end of the game. Now I'm seeing them suggest highly practical things or things that just don't work. Like let's use more than three 8 second buffs to do 250+% damage in the next hit. AS IF THE &gt;!BLACK BLADE!&lt; IS GOING TO SIT THERE **ON THE GROUND** AND LET YOU DO THAT!!! These bosses come down on you like a Kingdom Hearts super boss.

Running pure heavy STR build but Im concerned that power peaks too low to be competent after the first cycle So on my 2nd character Ive decided to go full on heavy weapons with super heavy armor to wash out the terrible taste going sorcery had left me which was long before most of the sorcery spells got buffed But even with that terrible sorcery build I could do extreme amount of damage to no end with comet azur However I kid you not my best spell was hoarfrost stomp and I abhor that But with this current build although Ive been plowing through things infinitely easier than my mage I wasnt in constant need of help or an invincible bodyguard crystalian But my power feels like its peaking And my heavy prelate hammer is 20 and my seeing little gain in leveling up strength after 60 Just 3s If it keeps up like that then is 90 more attack power going to cut it make 99 strength worth it No it wouldnt it couldnt be that bad\n",
      "\n",
      "Im stuck doing 700s and 1000s while my ground slam or golden slam does 900s Further increases by stats are so marginal its not worth putting on Godricks rune Radagons Sarseal and the Starcourge talisman All forms of self healing outside of tears is unreliable That is especially the one that heals you with simply hitting people because it turns out its PER ATTACK NOT PER HIT So dual wielding nor butt slamming a mob still only counts as 1 attack\n",
      "\n",
      "The colossal hammer doesnt hit straight so its been so clumsy I often wonder if it was worth leaving my longhaft axe for this the longest great axe in the game which is so long that it actually attacks behind yourself with its standard light attacks Even the difference in power makes me question if it was ever worth going to that prelate hammer Or even the poise damage which has been growing more and more unreliable even with ground slam and jump attacks For some STUPID reason certain man sized enemies like the banished knights cant be launched into the air and can barely be face planted So thats making me hesitant toward replacing the prelate hammer with the giant killer whose strong attack does not launch enemies into the air \n",
      "\n",
      "Jump attacking with a colossal hammer has been growing increasingly inconsistent with many enemies beyond Margot especially when more and more of these enemies turn into a whirlwind of death or emulate the fume knight complete with FROSTBITE every BREATHING moment where now my only two choices to win is to abuse their shoddy hit boxes OR grab a tower shield effectively nerfing my poise and poise damage to the ground And dont tell me to guard counter because you need to do it at the end of these combos otherwise you get hit and poise broken right out of it And these combos last for so long that stance breaking is just unreliable more like happy accident when it DOES happen\n",
      "\n",
      "So I look into guide vids to see how people are doing extreme damage since you really need to do extreme damage at the end of the game Now Im seeing them suggest highly practical things or things that just dont work Like lets use more than three 8 second buffs to do 250 damage in the next hit AS IF THE gtBLACK BLADElt IS GOING TO SIT THERE ON THE GROUND AND LET YOU DO THAT These bosses come down on you like a Kingdom Hearts super boss  BTW just to state my current progress I havent beatengtthe fire giant yetlt\n",
      "\n",
      "And my best option for going further beyond the peak of strength are 8 to 15 second buffs Which are mostly 20 power bonuses  With compound crap like this its no wonder why people think magic is overpowered\n",

      "\n",
      "TLDR: Scarlet Rot was caused by an unnamed outer god, probably something bug/fungus themed, who was eventually defeated by Malenia.  It can't be Malenia because her nuke blooms are accounted for and items imply came from the sealing of a rot god while Malenia doesn't ascend until your fight with her and she's not sealed.   Further, the pests were warped by rot from mere bugs into the sentient beings we find by this infection over time and then came to worship Malenia incorrectly as their creator.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the base logic for Malenia not being the ultimate source of the rot: \n",
      "\n",
      "If rotten lake was caused by sealing an outer god and Malenia was born cursed then there are only two possibilities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Malenia created the lake of rot because she was cursed, probably b/c incest.  This is false because she has bloomed three times and they are accounted for - the aeonian swamp, the haligtree, and against you in your fight.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The lake of rot is infected because scarlet rot doesn't come from Malenia\n",
      "\n",
      "What other evidence is there?  \n",
      "\n",
      "The strongest evidence is the Scorpion's Dagger, which states \"...*A ceremonial tool used by heretics, crafted from the relic of a sealed outer god\"* implying that the god that caused it has been sealed and that Miquella's needle alleviates scarlet rot specifically by warding off the influence of an outer god.\n",
      "\n",
      "If this god of rot was sealed beneath the lake of rot, then it is impossible for Malenia to be the origin of it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There's more as well: \n",
      "\n",
      "* Malenia was born cursed, but is never recorded to have fought near the lake.  We can also rule out the Haligtree being a carrier for Malenia's rot because: \n",
      "* The lake is far from the tree, there's no signs of roots, and the rot hasn't spread anywhere else (unlike the deathroot, the closest analogy), ruling out that Malenia spread it through the the haligtree roots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, but if not Malenia, then what's responsible for the rot?  Astel is obviously sealed beneath the lake and he has something like a scorpion tail, similar to the dagger, plus it's a bug as well, similar to the pests.  Astel is also called \"malformed star\", implying it itself is warped.  \n",
      "\n",
      "However, Astel shows no hint of rot or poison and it is, in fact, weak to scarlet rot, implying that Astel was sealed under the lake because the lake already existed and it formed a prison from which Astel could not escape.  \n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Blue Dancer item: \" *A cloth doll depicting a dancer garbed in blue.*  \n",
      "*An ancient heirloom of some sort...The dancer in blue represents a fairy, who in legend bestowed a flowing sword upon a blind swordsman. Blade in hand, the swordsman sealed away an ancient god — a god that was Rot itself.\"*\n",
      "\n",
      "So, my best guess is that this unnamed god's influence caused rot and it was bug/fungus, calling back to Nausica: Valley of the Wing, which Miyazaki references.  This is perhaps when we get the mushroom people and the corrupted tree avatars.  Malenia, already infected, is naturally immune and is able to kill or seal the god, though it's curse remains on her and her brother.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Over time, the rot also warped the surrounding insects as we see it doing to the animals in Caelid, eventually bring sentience to the pests, who are described as \"overgrown\" IE \"evolved\". \n",

      "Counter Theory: Malenia was the rot god all along.  She was fighting something near there and had a \"pre-bloom\" that caused her to leak rot for the first time.

However, in-game she gives the player a baldachin's blessing when you embrace her, and it drains your max health by 5%, meaning that she drains the life force of those who she sleeps with.  Fia slept with tarnished as they were about to die, and her doing so sapped the last remaining strength out of them while they were too weak to fight back, causing them to die.  When the Erdtree started blessing tarnished again, the ones she slept with and killed came back to life due to the grace reviving them, and she was likely driven out of her homeland by a mob of revived tarnished that she had drained of their life.

I absolutely believe he is the type of person who WOULD do something like this, but I don't really believe that's what happened, after all, if he could place some kind of curse on the body that would be powerful enough to incapacitate Sellen, wouldn't he just turn her into a puppet, and not a ball?

      "Sellen is called the Graven Witch and punished for the practice of forbidden magic. This forbidden magic, referred to in the Graven School and Graven Mass talismans is pretty directly connected to the balls of faces like the one sellen turns into.\n",

      "Sellen was kicked out of the academy for doing \"something terrible\" to other sorcerers. Despite seeming to be a kind and chill person,  Sorry Thops, but I do believe these rumors to be true, I think she did some dark experiments with her fellow sorcerers, leading to the creation of Graven-Masses (the type of ball she will eventually turn into)\n",
      "\n",
      "Sellen only transforms when the bodies of her former teachers are recovered. To me this means the transformation is directly a result of her ability to pursue her goals relating to primal current NOT any outside character or force. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sellen’s last dialogue to me, is oddly nefarious sounding, the way she says \"“Even my dullest pupils will always have a place here.” and from what we know about the graven school, shes likely alluding to continue her experiments with other sorcerers, “collecting them” as the item descriptions put it. This feels like the game is letting us know, she isn’t just celebrating her victory and stoping here, she has plans to continue her experiments now that she's back in the academy.\n",

      "\\# Part 2: Pondering the Ball\n",

      "My understanding from the Graven-School and Graven-Mass Talismans, is that it is an entity comprised of  sorcerers, or sorcerer bodyparts and transformed into an entity of immense magical power.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\###Why Do Graven Sorcerers make them?\n",
      "\n",
      "They are referred to as “Seeds of the stars” perhaps those who follow the primordial current believe that they can be transformed into the very stars themselves. The creation of these creatures is seen as scientific inquiry to Graven School practitioners. This to me seems less like Graven-Masses are a form of punishment for the recipient, and more an experiment done to try and learn more about magic. \n",
      "\n",
      "If this is the case, it seems Sellen becoming a ball might be the result of a scientific inquiry gone wrong, rather than something inflicted upon her by others. It seems to require multiple sorcerers to pull off,  so perhaps this is why she will always have need for even \"her dullest pupils\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\\### Are Graven Masses Failures?\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve seen a lot of people say that becoming a graven mass is what happens when you glimpse the primeval current and aren't strong enough to handle it. Instead of crystallization like masters Azur and Lusat, you are given the spicy ball, and transformed into a gross face thing. I strongly disagree with this interpretation. I don't believe Graven-Masses are mistakes at all, in fact, I believe them to be the desired outcome. If all you needed to do was glimpse the Primeval current, then what use do practitioners of the Graven School have for “Collecting” sorcerers and fashioning them into things?  If Graven-Masses were supposed to be a bad thing, why are they the symbol of the Graven School? Why would all of your talisman and paraphernalia be dedicated to the embarrassing failures of your craft?  \n",
      "\n",
      "I believe Graven Masses are made via grafting. It basically spells it out for us on the two Graven Talismans, practitioners “collect” sorcerers and “fashion” them into the seeds of the stars. You collect a bunch of really intelligent people and fuse them in an attempt to effectively ascend, maybe into the stars themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\###How Did Sellen Accidentally Graft Herself Into a Ball? \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think she did. My theory is that Sellen only transforms into a Graven-Mass herself once the two bodies of the Primeval Sorcerers are recovered because she wants them to become a part of her, it’s my belief that Sellen WANTS to become a graven mass, but hopes to use only the best “collected” sorcerers to ensure that she winds up a particularly potent “seed of the stars”. This is why she needs the bodies of her two teachers returned to the academy, and why we can't seem to find them despite her confirming to us that they arrived.\n",
      "\n",
      " It's likely she views becoming a Graven Mass not as a horrible punishment or failure, but as a desirable state of being, as the peak of her scientific achievements and natural next step in bringing back primeval knowledge. Sellen’s last bit of dialogue, saying that “Even my dullest pupils will always have a place here.” feels like she is alluding not just to her experiments going to resume again, but maybe even that, we, her dear pupil, should we fail to become elden lord, might even be worthy to join her, as part of her gross ball form, something that, while horrifying, I do wonder if she means as a compliment?

      " Why does Sellen only transform when both of her masters bodies are recovered Why would Rennala be waiting for that particular trigger to act\n",
      " My final piece of evidence isnt even really evidence its just faith in the writers at Fromsoft to not write Sellens story to end this way What does getting owned by a demigod have to do with Sellens storyline at all Sellens storyline is much more about delving into strange and forbidden magic that we see can transform its users its not REALLY about Rennala so it feels unfitting for her to be the reason it ends\n",

      "Sellen was kicked out of the academy for doing something terrible to other sorcerers Despite seeming to be a kind and chill person  Sorry Thops but I do believe these rumors to be true I think she did some dark experiments with her fellow sorcerers leading to the creation of GravenMasses the type of ball she will eventually turn into\n",
      "\n",
      "Sellen only transforms when the bodies of her former teachers are recovered To me this means the transformation is directly a result of her ability to pursue her goals relating to primal current NOT any outside character or force \n",
      "\n",
      "Sellen’s last dialogue to me is oddly nefarious sounding the way she says “Even my dullest pupils will always have a place here” and from what we know about the graven school shes likely alluding to continue her experiments with other sorcerers “collecting them” as the item descriptions put it This feels like the game is letting us know she isn’t just celebrating her victory and stoping here she has plans to continue her experiments now that shes back in the academy\n",

      "Why Do Graven Sorcerers make them\n",
      "\n",
      "They are referred to as “Seeds of the stars” perhaps those who follow the primordial current believe that they can be transformed into the very stars themselves The creation of these creatures is seen as scientific inquiry to Graven School practitioners This to me seems less like GravenMasses are a form of punishment for the recipient and more an experiment done to try and learn more about magic \n",
      "\n",
      "If this is the case it seems Sellen becoming a ball might be the result of a scientific inquiry gone wrong rather than something inflicted upon her by others It seems to require multiple sorcerers to pull off  so perhaps this is why she will always have need for even her dullest pupils\n",
      "\n",
      " Are Graven Masses Failures\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve seen a lot of people say that becoming a graven mass is what happens when you glimpse the primeval current and arent strong enough to handle it Instead of crystallization like masters Azur and Lusat you are given the spicy ball and transformed into a gross face thing I strongly disagree with this interpretation I dont believe GravenMasses are mistakes at all in fact I believe them to be the desired outcome If all you needed to do was glimpse the Primeval current then what use do practitioners of the Graven School have for “Collecting” sorcerers and fashioning them into things  If GravenMasses were supposed to be a bad thing why are they the symbol of the Graven School Why would all of your talisman and paraphernalia be dedicated to the embarrassing failures of your craft  \n",
      "\n",
      "I believe Graven Masses are made via grafting It basically spells it out for us on the two Graven Talismans practitioners “collect” sorcerers and “fashion” them into the seeds of the stars You collect a bunch of really intelligent people and fuse them in an attempt to effectively ascend maybe into the stars themselves\n",

      "I dont think she did My theory is that Sellen only transforms into a GravenMass herself once the two bodies of the Primeval Sorcerers are recovered because she wants them to become a part of her it’s my belief that Sellen WANTS to become a graven mass but hopes to use only the best “collected” sorcerers to ensure that she winds up a particularly potent “seed of the stars” This is why she needs the bodies of her two teachers returned to the academy and why we cant seem to find them despite her confirming to us that they arrived\n",
      "\n",
      " Its likely she views becoming a Graven Mass not as a horrible punishment or failure but as a desirable state of being as the peak of her scientific achievements and natural next step in bringing back primeval knowledge Sellen’s last bit of dialogue saying that “Even my dullest pupils will always have a place here” feels like she is alluding not just to her experiments going to resume again but maybe even that we her dear pupil should we fail to become elden lord might even be worthy to join her as part of her gross ball form something that while horrifying I do wonder if she means as a compliment I mean by all accounts Sellen seems like she might be seriously unhinged so her kindness towards us or Thops doesn’t necessarily mean she isnt capable of bizarre monstrous things \n",

I'm curious after reading the description for Fia's Mist: \"This sorcery was developed to oppose the Roundtable Hold, and is effective only against the Tarnished.\" Seems like the Blight is something created by Those Who Live In Death to protect themselves against the Golden Order? The animation also looks like sickly undead vines wrapping into their target, so I'm wondering if it's a sickness related to the Erdtree.

      "\n",
      "Here are the results:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Honorable Mention** - Spirit Jellyfish (+10) with .25 Knights. She tried her best, but was essentially stunlocked the entire fight by the Crucible Knight. She was able to shoot her poison a couple times but not enough to proc, and I ended up stepping in. She is an excellent support pick due to her large health pool and range but she did not do very well at all in single combat. \n",
      "\n",
      "**12th Place** - Depraved Perfumer Carmaan (+9) with .33 Knights. He was staggered easily and continuously, didn’t really stand a chance. Solid pick against groups because of his AOE attacks though.\n",
      "\n",
      "**11th Place** - Cleanrot Knight Finlay (+10) with .66 Knights. He did a bit better than Carmaan, but possibly only because he was fully upgraded. Easy to stagger, fairly poor damage output.\n",
      "\n",
      "**10th Place** - Omenkiller Rollo (+10) with 1.33 Knights. This one surprised me a bit! Rollo is very aggressive but his damage output turned out to be lower than I assumed. He held his own but went down quickly once the second Knight spawned. \n",
      "\n",
      "**9th Place** - Black Knife Tiche (+9) also with 1.33 Knights. I give him the edge over Rollo here because he performed just as well with only a +9. He’s very evasive, and his ranged DOT attack was particularly effective against the Knight, but he doesn’t use it often enough. \n",
      "\n",
      "**8th Place** - Blackflame Monk Amon (+10) with 1.5 Knights. Amon did well, he’s staggered easily but when he is actually able to use his Blackflame DOT attacks they do big damage. I think he would be an excellent support summon, he just doesn’t do that well under constant pushing by the Crucible Knight. \n",
      "\n",
      "**7th Place** - Nightmaiden and Swordstress Puppets - (+9) with 1.5 Knights. These two are a solid pick. They are staggered pretty easily by the cruciblle knight but they are good about trading aggro so they survived a long time. The Nightmaiden’s whip has excellent range range, consistent damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6th Place** - Marionette Soldiers (+10) with 2 Knights. Here is another summon that performed much better than what I assumed. They traded aggro back and forth very effectively and they do a lot of damage at range. Their downfall is that once the first one dies, the second one goes down very quickly with all the focus on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5th Place** - Banished Knight Oleg (+9) with 1.5 Knights. Oleg did very well considering he was only +9 here. He was staggered more than I thought he would be, but several of his attacks seem to have hyper-armor, allowing him to deal consistent damage. \n",
      "\n",
      "**4th Place** - Lhutel The Headless (+10) with 2 Knights! This was a good fight. She definitely felt a bit tankier than her friends, and she deals more consistent damage because she will always use her spear throw when she isn’t close enough to engage directly. She was also staggered less often.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3rd Place** - Greatshield Soldiers (+10) with 2.5 Knights!! - I had never tried these guys until this test and I am extremely impressed. They don’t do much damage but they also barely take damage themselves so they lasted a long time. It was a slow battle of attrition with the Knight.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2nd Place** - Mimic Tear (+10) wielding Commander’s Standard (+10) and Brass Shield (+25) - 3 Knights. In my opinion the Mimic has absolutely survived its nerf. It is tanky, has significantly better damage output than the other summons, and actually used the Commander’s Standard WA at appropriate times during the fight. Obviously the strength of your mimic is going to depend on your character, but he isn’t wielding anything broken here. Which brings me to our winner. \n",
      "\n",
      "**1st Place** - Mimic Tear (+10) wielding Heavy Lance (+25) with Giant Hunt AoW, Heavy Fingerprint Stone Shield (+25), and Full Lionel’s Armor - A whopping 4.5 Knights! An extremely well equipped +10 Mimic absolutely handled the Crucible Knight 4 and a half times. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is even more impressive when you consider that the Mimic is the only summon on this list that can actually be affected by the Crucible Knight’s grab attack, which he uses constantly. \n",
      "\n",
      "The ability to attack from behind a shield with the lance seemed to make a big difference, and definitely extended his life. The only consumable I gave him was a Raw Meat Dumpling, which he used once. He also used his Flask of Crimson Tears once. \n",
      "\n",
      "The results are pretty conclusive, and I can definitely see why the Mimic was nerfed if it still performs this well. I would have liked to test the pre-nerf version with its constant consumable use. \n",
      "\n",
      "For reference on my Mimic, my character’s stats during this test were 70 Strength, 55 Endurance, and 50 Vigor at level 150. For my own reference I tested 12 popular spirit summons against a convenient respawning miniboss Here are the results Spoilers ahead regarding Road’s End Catacombs\n",

      "\n",
      "Now my theory is, starting from the Radhan fight, things were scripted as such in terms of lore to make the matrimony possible. How it works is this :\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Sellen eventually asks you to kill the shard bearer Radhan bcs he is \"blocking the stars\" or something and needs you to kill him to restore the stars. She is perhaps underneath this in subtext means to say, the tarnished killing Radhan would make the stars \"free\" as such thereby making them \"align\" for the tarnished and Ranni to be wed on a particular day / month. This theory is emboldened by the fact that Sellen I think works for Seluvis who is in the employ of Ranni\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Once you do kill Radhan Ranni has you go to the eternal city for something. This is again probably bcs that city has been lost for ages and she knows it's filled with deep dark monsters and difficult areas for the tarnished to traverse. But she wants the tarnished to traverse it so that they can prove themselves worthy to her. This is going by the 15th century \"chivalrous knight\" logic. The knights were brave and would slay a dragon for their maiden.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The tarnished kills Renalla who happens to be Rannis mother. Now even the game is on this matrimony boat, bcs by killing his mother, you effectively remove the need for Ranni to get her mother's blessing to marry you(the tarnished). Also helps that you do kill Radagon later who's supposedly her dad, but that's a different ending. But that wouldn't matter considering Radagon left Rennala for the throne and thus let us assume that Radagon does not care whether u marry Ranni or not.\n",

       "       'My list of Elden Ring bosses ranked from easiest to hardest. Part 1 Hey all since Elden ring has been out for 8 months now Ive pretty much explored every nook and cranny in the game and have played NG+ a few times and since we got the announcement of Bloodborne 2 I figured ill put this list up like I do with all the other Soulsborne games. So ill start in order with the easiest bosses to the hardest. Note that this os only part 1 where I do the first 9 bosses, Ill do the last 7 in a second part because those rankings might be more controversial.\\n\\n1.  Glaive Master Hodir- The most easiest pathetic boss of this game. I mean I dont really know if you wanna classify him as a real boss even though he had a big health pool. All you had to do was dodge or parry his easy telegraphed glaive sweeps and go in and do some heavy attacks. His back would be turned for a few seconds and some probably used a health flask because of some easy mistakes but this boss puts witches of hemwick to shame. I killed him in my first try.\\n2. Moss Beast of Drumvar- I might get some backlash for not putting this one in the number one spot. This boss was very easy to kill however if you got caught in his grab animation it would delete you for 80% health and the fact that he is located in the Swamp of Damnation makes the corpse run ever so exhasuting if you do manage to die. I learned the hard way but eventually I killed him in my second try. \\n3. Miserable Apparations- Here we start to pick up the pace, I actually died 4 times to these fuckers because I am an idiot and didnt read the loading screen text that ghost type enemies have weakness to Holy weapons so I had to equip the blade of pure light and eventaully these guys went down fast, reminded me a bit of shadows of yharnam but after the typical shrieking attacks they do I just hide behind the stone and get free hits in. ez pz.\\n4. Splinters of Madness- FUCK THIS BOSS. The stupid rooting mechanics mixed with the small tree ads that sprout up was really annoying. Obviously its best to use fire weapons on this boss, I know some people went to attack the main body of the tree but I had to attack the roots just to be safe, I didnt want to risk it plus im not the best at dodging the falling tree limbs. For an early game boss I was surprised he was this tough, I probably died like 8 times? Idk but man that boss is extremely hard if you dont use fire.\\n5. Jarls of the Three Kingdoms- This was such a cool fight. I knew the horses were scared of the loud explosions so thats how I got the guys to dismount and from there it wasnt too bad, I prefered to use a lighter weapon on this fight like the Shortsword of Vir with the poison specilization. Since the guys are humans they take more damage to poisons. It was a tough fight but not once when I died did I think it was cheap, all my deaths were deserved. Also 10/10 on the death animations where you stab them through their mouths and slice their throat through. \\n6.  Thaumaturge Faur- This is my most favorite boss of the whole game in terms of art design and animations, combined with the popped effects of his dark appearance mixed with the crystal glacier you fight inside, there is nothing I expect less from Miyazaki. His ice balls and spikes were hard and tedious to dodge. The only thing making him so high on this list is his 2 shot mechanic with the staff sweep thing he does. And when he summons those rotting corpses or whatever the fuck they were. The ads were easy to ignore but I killed them just to be safe. \\n7. Home of the Fowl- This boss scared the shit out of me because I was talking to the old lady outside and never thought I was close to another boss encounter just after fighting the moss beast. But then nope the house has these giant chicken legs and fucking wrecks my shit. I really didnt like this boss that much as its your typical ankle hitting boss notorious in Soulsborne games but other than the annoying slam attacks and kicks there wasnt a diverse set of attacks, however if you do managed to get hit it was pretty much over with the flurry and the instakill grab animation. Im sure most people struggled with this boss despite Lobos and Ela one shotting it. \\n8.  Stryzga Reanimated- This is the boss that made me take a short break from the game before I came back, with the annoying shapeshifting and the hard owl phase at the end I knew I had to take a break. I admit I searched a guide on youtube from Fextra but idc man this boss was hard for me. I found it extremely difficult to dodge the acid spew as well as the pouncing leaps. I know this boss dies easily to spells but I just didnt spec into them I feel the spells in the game are a little unreliable so I just brute forced into weaponry spec. After that big slam attack she does I could get like 3 free heavy hits in but still I died reatedly after that last fucking phase man. When she transforms into that purple tiger beast It only got worse for me. Yeah yeah I know inb4 the \"hur dur I one shotted this boss you fucking pleb.\" I prob died like 20 or so times to this bitch. \\n9. Sunken Fossegrim- I thought this boss was meh in terms of artistic design, other than the cool view from the Struvir Lake in the back this guy wasnt to appealing to the eyes. The only reason thiss boss is up so high is because of the fucking dread mechanic that Miyazaki decided to bring back. Man fuck this mechanic we didnt like terror in sekiro yet he decides to bring it back because he wants us to suffer. I dont have enough soothing oils to bring with me when I encountered him the first few times so I had to go all the way back and farm some from the lock beasts near the lake. The second phase when he does his screams was the worst I just got muscle memory from it and walked all the way back then charged at him again to hit his health, rinse and repeat. I put him high on the list because his dread shit got me a few times and he does have other attacks that are hard to get used to like hdiig behind the wood pillars to avoid his waves. \\n\\nWell those are the first 9 bosses guys let me know what you think ill be putting part 2 eventually with the last remaining 7 bosses. I figured Id make this list after we got the confirmation of Bloodborne 2 at e3 2021. And since BB2 is coming out I know most people are probably done wit ER. Alright guys peace out.',\n",
       "       \"Greater Ringwyrm is the Pinwheel of this game Everyone is all focused on how ridiculous Glaive Master Holdir is right now, but can we take a moment to talk about how pathetic this floppy parasite was? First of all, he's just a reskinned Lesser Ringwyrm. And his moveset isn't all that different, except for the extra bleed damage on his grab attack.\\n\\nWhen I first beat this guy I literally sat in silence for a full minute waiting for a second phase that never came. Here's hoping the rest of the bosses don't go out this easily.\",\n",
       "       'My theory on Sadaran\\'s real identity Sadaran might actually be one of the Jarls of the Three Kingdoms.\\n\\nThe only thing his weapon description says is: \"Worn spear wielded by Sadaran of Seven Sands. The engraved wood shows signs of countless years of wear, yet the weapon maintains a surprising integrity. Sadaran was once a renowned horseman, exiled from the Glass for crimes unknown. When he traveled north, he sought glory.\"\\n\\nThe description mentions he was not only a horseman, but also from the Glass, aka the same desert that Hachili mentioned being from. If you notice, one of the Jarls has apparel that very much resembles the sort of stuff that they\\'d wear in the Glass, aka the sort of armor that Hachili wears. And this is the only Jarl to look that way, whereas the other two look more fitting for their region.\\n\\nAlso, notice how Sadaran\\'s spirit only appears to you AFTER the Jarls boss fight. And when you first meet him he starts to go off into cryptic stories about reclaiming his throne. This confirms that he was some sort of noble, aka a Jarl.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure what the point of the twist was, making a boss enemy into a friendly ghost, but it\\'s still a neat detail.',\n",

       " \"Apprentice Eichoberin, The frozen forest and how to get there. So, guys, I've managed to go through the frozen forest area which is hidden behind Glaive Master Hodir's arena. For those who don't know how to get into the frozen forest, you need to use the power of the cross you obtained from the Church Grim boss fight in the Hodir's Arena. Normally attempting to resurrect a boss it would give you an item that cannot be used but does contain a lore tablet for the boss. However when I tried to get Hodir's item,  however, in this case, it temporarily resurrected him and it initiated a cutscene where he grabbed me, tossed me up in the air and throws his glaive at me launching me into the air off into the area known as the Frozen Forest. I woke up with about 10% hp and my only weapon on me being Hodir's Glaive. The Frozen Forest is a large open area with an actually fair version of the blizzard of frigid outskirts from dark souls 2. I did find it weird how I kept on finding the same weapon over and over again called an ice glaive. there decent amount of content in the area with a bunch of lore stuff regarding the story of Glaive Master Hodir such as his upbringing, his training and his years in search of the Elden ring. There is also a bit about his apprentice who managed to best him in martial and went to the frozen forest to meditate on his life. I then found a shrine which was an obvious boss arena. You can probably guess what I did next. So I entered the shrine to encounter a similar figure to Hodir who we can guess the title of. \\n\\nBefore I talk about the fight, I want to talk about the arena of the shrine. It's near-identical to Hodir's arena, but with a bunch of empty slots, you need to put all the ice halberds that you have collected into the slots before you fight the apprentice. So the fight starts off with the apprentice jumping down into the center of the arena and starting with Hodir's iconic attack of the glaive snipe. and so begins the fight. This fight is a faster, tankier and stronger Hodir with added AOE at the cost o having to grab a new glaive every time he breaks one to use an ice AOE attack however, when we get to the second phase, we stray a little bit away from hodir with a completely unique take on the glaive snipe where he tosses 3 glaives in the air in quick succession to only jump up in the air to kick the glaives towards you. After the glaive kick attack he starts focusing on causing chain reaction attacks using the embedded ice glaives to cause ice explosions where the glaives are. This continues until he runs out of glaives to use and starts using his remaining tools left to him, those being his fists and kicks. Unfortunately, I died right after he transitioned to using his fists so I can't really give more info on the boss.\",\n",
